* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won

The Score-Panel displays reset, time taken and star rating of top 5 scores sorted by number of moves. Try matching all the cards before 10 moves to get 3 stars! :)
